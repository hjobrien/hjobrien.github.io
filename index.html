                                <p>We knew that we wanted to use the kinect sensor to scan the table as our primary
                                    method of sensing. Our team has some experience with 3D modeling and 3D printing,
                                    so we quickly settled on 3D printing a kinect mount to sit on the metal interface plate below
                                    the sawyer's zero-g cuff.

                                    After some discussion with the TAs we found out that the most common technique
                                    for acquiring kinect input was to mount it on a fixed tripod, find the transform between
                                    the kinect sensor and the table, and obtain our data from that. We elected not to pursue
                                    this approach ourselves for three reasons:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The tripod approach is very sensitive and prone to setup details and tuning
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>One of our goals with this project was to be robust to variations in the environment,
                                                specifically with different shaped objects positioned in different parts of the
                                                grasping region. If we relied on manually setting up the kinect on a tripod somewhere in the room
                                                before each attempt, not only would we spend a great deal of time making sure it was in exaclty the correct
                                                position (or tuning programmatic constants), we would also risk us or others in the lab
                                                bumping the tripod and forcing us to recalibrate frequently</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li> The angle of scans produced from a kinect-mounted tripod is highly suboptimal
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    When we were determining where to move the arm to grasp an object and also how to grasp it,
                                                    we relied heavily on the top-down nature of our scans, they enabled us to see the object from
                                                    the same perspective our gripper would be seeing it from, and also allowed us
                                                    to change the angle from which we saw the object as we adjusted the robot arm.
                                                    This feedback proved especially vital to our final approach, specifically in that it allowed us to use a closed
                                                    loop controller for arm movement, which dramatically improved our
                                                    results over earlier attempts.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Furthermore, we would not be able to distinguish gripping patterns for wide classes of objects if we used the tripod approach
                                                In the case of the rectangular box, having the overhead view allowed us to find the short axis of the box
                                                which was the only direction we were able to grip it in. For more complicated objects like the hat, its irregular
                                                structure would have been impossible to grasp without an overhead view.</li>
                                            </ul>


                                        </li>
                                    <li>
                                        With an eye to future work, when the object's top becomes highly textured, such as in the case
                                        of a lego block, it would be useful to incorporate diffent kinect scan angles to improve the resolution and grasp quality of our approach.
                                        However, putting the kinect on the tripod fixes the data angle, and would prevent us from pursing such a modification in the future.
                                    </li>
                                    </ul>

In addition to noise, the Kinect sets the value of pixel's it can't accurately detect depth for to 2048. The values that we care about are generally within the range of 350 and 700. We ignore any values that are clipped to 2048 for classification purposes, and treat these values as part of the background.

                                    The depth values within the image typically follow a bimodal distribution; a smaller mode for the depth of the object and a larger mode for the depth of the background. This distribution is typically roughly Gaussian, thus we can calssify each pixel using a Guassian Mixture Model to create an image segmentation of object versus background.

                                <p>
                                    We assume the distribution of depth values for the object are i.i.d. and follow the mixture of two Gaussians, where one Gaussian corresponds to the object and the other to the background. Let \(v_{ij}\) be the observed value at \((i,j)\), we then maximize our likelihood over possible mixtures of two Gaussians.
                                     $$\max \limits_{\phi_o, \phi_b, \mu_o, \mu_b, \sigma_o, \sigma_b} \prod_{i,j} p(v_{ij}) \; : $$
                                     $$p = \phi_o \mathcal{N}(\mu_o, \sigma_o) + \phi_b \mathcal{N}(\mu_b, \sigma_b)$$
                                     $$\phi_o + \phi_b = 1, \; \phi_o \geq 0 , \; \phi_b \geq 0$$
                                    This problem can be solved within very few iterations of Expectation Maximization implemented in Scikit Learn (we found 10 iterations to be consistent). Also, while our assupmtions of the the depth values being i.i.d. worked in practice, it is a strong assumption, and future work may explore using conditional probabilities or connectivity for classification.

                                    Once we converge to a viable mixture, we can use it for classification. First, we low pass the image to remove high frequency noise and soften the edges. We found this led to cleaner segmentations than classifying on the original image. We then use our converged mixture model to classify each pixel independently.

Our object's depth values should be smaller than the depth values of the background, so without loss of generality let \(\mu_o^* \leq \mu_b^*\). Defining \(p_o = \mathcal{N}(\mu_o^*, \sigma_o^*)\) and \(p_b = \mathcal{N}(\mu_b^*, \sigma_b^*)\), we clasify a pixel value \(v_{ij}\) using the function
                                    $$f(v_{ij}) = \begin{cases} 1 \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \phi_o^* p_o(v_{ij}) \geq \phi_b^* p_b(v_{ij}) \\

                                    To find the center of mass of the object, we first assume the object has uniform density. Letting the normalization of the segmentation be a joint probability distribution over the indices, the center of mass is then the expected index.
                                    $$\begin{bmatrix} c_x \\ c_y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i,j} f(v_{ij})}\sum_{i,j} f(v_{ij}) \begin{bmatrix} i \\ j \end{bmatrix}$$

                                    Because our gripper was the two-prong gripper, adapting to specific objects mainly required determining at which angle to grasp the object.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First we continue to assume the object has uniform density. We make an additional assumption that the object is simply connected. We then center the grasp above the detected center of mass, as this would balance the mass on either side of the gripper.
                                </p>

                                    Before lowering the end-affector, we determine an angle to rotate the gripper by. We approached this problem using a heuristic and approximating a corresponding optimization problem. When picking up objects that are uniform density, a natural approach would be to grab the object around the plane passing through the center of mass that minimizes the cross sectional area. For example, a human picks up a dumbell around the small cylinder connecting the two large pieces, as opposed to across the ends of the two large pieces. We now formalize a way to solve for this heuristic.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    First, we define the indicator function \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow {0, 1}\) that is centered at the center of mass (center of mass corresponds to \((0,0)\)) where \(f(x,y) = 1\) if the object occupies \((x,y)\) and \(f(x,y)=0\) otherwise.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A line passing through the origin at angle \(\theta\) is then defined as
                                    $$\mathcal{L(\theta)} = \left \{ (t \cos \theta , t \sin \theta)  \; | \; t \in \mathbb{R} \right \}$$
                                    Our goal is to find a line passing through the origin that minimizes the intersection of the line and the object. Thus, our optimization problem is
                                    $$\theta^* = \argmin \limits_{\theta \in \left [\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t \cos \theta, t \sin \theta) \text{d}t$$
                                    The objective function is \(\pi\)-periodic, allowing us to restrict the domain. In general, the objective function is not convex on \(\theta\). However, for reasonable applications, grid search is effective at finding a close to optimal solution. Additionally, if the object is a convex set, the objective function is Lipschitz-continuous on \(\theta\) allowing for a theoretical guarantee of obtaining the optimal solution using bisection method.
                                </p>

                                    After having found an angle to grasp at, the end-affector is rotated by that angle and then lowered to the object. For objects that aren't simply connected (such as a donut), this algorithm might have a harder time as it would attempt to grasp around the entire object as opposed to using the holes in the object to its advantage. This is an area we hope to explore more in the future.

                                <p> There are two primary components to our design, the blue cuff in the center of the image, and the two black clips which retain the kinect sensor itself.
                                These are bolted onto the blue cuff. All plastic parts were 3D printed, we used both the Cory Supernode and the Moffit Makerspace
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-6">
                                <p> When we were going about designing our Kinect mount, we had two primary designs.
                                    The first was one that would interface using screws to the Reflex Takktile gripper,
                                    in much the same way that Nandita's group did in a past semester. However, when it
                                    became clear that we were going to switch over to the electric parallel gripper,
                                    we had to design a new interface.</p>

                                <p>We ended up designing the cuff to sit around the metal wrist of Sawyer for a couple reasons.
                                Firstly, we wanted to make installation and removal of our interface quick and easy, so avoiding more
                                screws and bolts was appealing. Secondly, because the wire connecting the parallel gripper to Sawyer is very short,
                                it would be challenging to slip an interface plate between the gripper and the arm, to say nothing of having to get new longer screws
                                to screw the gripper on that would be long enough to pass through our interface. However, because we were no longer using screws,
                                we faced the issue of keeping our interface in the same position for each round. We solved this using two techniques.</p>

                                <p>To try to constrain our interface rotationally, we started by simply desnging the part to have close to a friction fit on the arm,
                                which then let us add tape to the inside of the part, prodiucing a good friction fit. Note the curved plastic arcs coming off the blue
                                piece in the image, these were used to start the interface in the same position each time we installed the gripper. We would position the blue plastic
                                piece in such a way around the cuff that one of the arcs would be in contact with the electric parallel gripper. Originally our hope
                                with these arcs was to snugly fit around the curve in the gripper itself, but that proved too challening to design and the friction-fit approach
                                worked suitably well that we continued with that.</p>

                                <p>The black kinect clips are designed to snugly fit around the kinect, and are designed a few milimeters too thin
                                in order to utilize the flexing of the plastic to keep the kinect in position. Experimentally, they kept the kinect from slipping
                                even when held such that the kinect opening was parallel to the floor </p>

                                <p>As a future extension, it would be good to change this part to one that is screwed onto the robot arm itself to increase repeatability
                                of our approach. We made that tradeoff primarily for time reasons for this project, but a rigidly attrached end effector would increase reliability
                                 and its disadvantages would be mitigate by not having to install and uninstall it frequently.</p>
